**APPROACH:**

>This is where I first began before I became stuck in several places and found it more useful to begin on Task 2. I knew little about Unity, VR, and how to execute a client-server implementation. I researched the following on the internet and YouTube:

>>Unity

>>MPEG-DASH

>>VR Video-Players

>>How to setup Client-Server

>Additionally I tried to read through the information in the pensieve repo but it was incredibly daunting to me at first. I moved on to experimenting in Unity and simulating it on my Windows Desktop. I followed along with a YouTube tutorial on how to build a 2d VR Media Player (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5vI4oRonoM&t=309s).Even if this was not my ultimate goal I wanted to gain more experience with Unity and what a good result may look like.

>My understanding did not sufficiently increase and so I began Task 2 which actually helped a fair amount.Learning about the process and how it is implemented by Dragonfly helped me learn a fair bit on what I needed to deliver for Task 1.While I had done some setup prior I now retackled Task 1 with renewed interest.

**SETUP:**

>We begin by downloading Unity Hub and creating an account before downloading Unity.Assuming you do not have a VR device we want to be able to simulate control in Unity. In which case, navigate to :
>>Window -> Package Manager.
>>
>Under Package Manager we will search for MockHMD XR Plugin and download it. Navigate back to the main screen and go to:
>> Edit-> Project Settings.
>> 
>Under Project Settings we can navigate down to XR - Plugin Management and tick the box for Mock HMD Loader.

We should now be able to simulate VR control with mouse and keyboard by pressing play and following the controls on-screen.
This was unfortunately my limits to simulating streaming to a video player, as I could get a media player working in unity but was unable to program the backend.
